#Fonto PHP Framework

Fonto is built as a PHP framework with flexibility in mind.
You, as an user, can easily decide what kind of packages you need by making use of composer and just download
them through the composer repository. Fonto is in no way meant to be competing with other
frameworks, it's just a little project that I made. As you will notice, Fonto, is a work in progress
and over time it will change dramatically. This is just a start and hopefully it can be 'fontozing'
in the future.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Fonto is by cloning this repo into a folder on your local machine
or on a server. Then you run composer to install the needed dependencies. You are now ready
to go. Please bear in mind that this is a beta release.
